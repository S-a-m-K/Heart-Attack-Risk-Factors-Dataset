Since it is a smaller dataset, I decided to do the cleaning, analysis and visualization using Excel.

### Data Exploration
Excel: []()  

### Observations:

5. Checking for dublicate rows
Since the dataset does not contain any personal information about the patients, which would identify them as unique, there is no point in checking the set for duplicates.

6. Checking if ride_id has a length of 16
...

7. Checking if timestamp values all have the same length
...

8. Checking for whitespace and find 161 rows
...

9. Count number of trips per bike
...

10. Total trips that last longer than a day
...

11. Total trips that last shorter than a minute
...

12. Check if how many rows has all location details
...

13. Which members use which station and how many times
...

14. How many times members and casuals rent a bike
...
